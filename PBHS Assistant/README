| CHANGE LOG |

** 1.2.2 **
Fixed the theme view function.

** 1.2.1 **
Added a shortcut to load the live widget view for a wordpress site.

Content scripts are now executed when needed instead of all the scripts being loaded at once.
This allows you to register a new script without adding it to the manifest file.
Now only the globalFunctions script is loaded at first.

** 1.2.0 **
Created paFunctions, a javascript object that holds all of the registered functions. With this in place really long switch statements
aren't needed, just pass in the request.type and as long as a function exists with that name it will run.

Added a button to purge files from the new memory cache.

Functions that require being logged in now only run when the user is logged in.

** 1.1.1 **
Fixed ajax code so that it will run on secure sites

** 1.1.0 **
Added DNS Lookup tool.

** 1.0.2 **
Can now navigate to the new 212X templates using the omnibar shortcut

** 1.0.1 **
You can use the purge files button to purge the theme.css file again. It uses the new tag: purge to purge all of the files
specified by the themes web.config file.

** 1.0.0 **
The one that changes everything. again.

Removed all of the button/status specific code from the popup.
Now everything uses a common callback depending on the type and any messages are set directly in the content scripts.

To add a new feature (plugin) define your plugin in plugins.json in the options folder by giving it a title, name, description, and type.
This will set up a toggle in the options page and depending on the type a button or status field in the popup.
Next you'll add your plugin code to the scripts folder. Name your js file with the same name you provided in your plugins.json entry

You will still need to hook up your button and your function by setting up a listener in background.js, just follow the other examples for that.

To pass information back to the button use the callback to send a status object with fields for 'completed' (bool) and 'message' (string)
The button or status field will handle an error situation (completed : false) and display the message to the user.

** 0.10.3 **
Cleaned up the options page.

** 0.10.2 **
Fixed bad logic that ran SEO check up whenever it wanted to run

** 0.10.1 **
SEO Page check only runs if user has enabled the SEO Check up module in their layout settings

** 0.10.0 **
Added SEO Check up functionality
Checks page for images without alt tags, badly formed page slugs, and images that are bigger than they need to be

** 0.9.1 **
Updated input values for paste function
Added Specialty and Nearby Locations fields to copy/paste functions

** 0.9.0 **
Right click to purge! Right click on any image and you will have the option to purge it from the cdn.
This will only work on images sourced from pbhs-sites/freewaysites. Attempting to purge any other image will
result in an alert message to the user.

Version numbers will now follow this format: MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH
An increase in the MAJOR number occurs when there is a re-write or re-organization of the code such that the functions interact differently than before (re-writing the communication among content, background, and popup scripts)
An increase in the MINOR number occurs when there is a new feature ( adding login functionality )
An increase in the PATCH number occurs when an existing feature is fixed or modified ( changing login function to one click instead of two )

Version numbers are always increased by one and an increase in a number will reset all following numbers to 0.
This will be more meaningful once we hit a 1.0.0 release.


** 0.8.2.1 **
Updated copy/paste function to target recently updated input fields in WordPress admin

** 0.8.2 **
Login button now only requires one click

** 0.8.1 **
Added option to clear minified files.
Moved some of the more globally useful functions into their own file.
Removed unnecessary log messages.

** 0.8.0 **
Refactored code and added comments to hopefully make it easier to add additional functionality.
All functions now communicate with the popup in the same way.
Updated change log to only contain the last 5 updates.
Removed feature description from read me as the options page contains descriptions of each function already.

** 0.7.7 **
Added purge files button.
