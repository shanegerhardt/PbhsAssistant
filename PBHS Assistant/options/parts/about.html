<h1>PBHS Assistant</h1>
<p>This extension is loaded with useful features
  that help with different kinds of work at PBHS.
  Probably the most useful is the login function
  which with two clicks logs you into any of our
  wordpress or older template sites. Click on
  "User Credentials" in the side menu to get this set up.</p>

<p>There are other useful features here as well,
  you can add them one at a time (eventually) by clicking on the
  "Layout" link in the side menu.</p>
